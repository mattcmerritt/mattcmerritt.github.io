## COVID-CT Starlight Saviors

COVID-CT Starlight Saviors is a project that aimed to improve on a [machine learning model made by UCSD](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT) to test patients for COVID-19 using CT scans taken of the lungs. My team was tasked with expanding the dataset available for training the neural network, which would ideally provide a more accurate model. We ended up expanding the dataset to contain 3227 images, and I had to include Python scripts to decompress and sort all the images. I also wrote a Python script that would divide the images into even subsets that would be use to train, evaluate, and test the new model. A report describing my team's work is available [here](https://github.com/walkerjbuckle/COVID-CT-Starlight-Saviors/blob/b6e8c0cbbe5cf0136a4179754237b1aa5bd51b46/docs/COVID-CT%20Starlight%20Saviors%20Team%203%20-%20Dataset%20Expansion.pdf).

This was my first time working with Git and GitHub to collaborate with many people simultaneously on a large scale project, which showed me the importance of planning. Additionally, this project also allowed me to get more experience working with Python, Linux, virtual machines, and neural networks.

## Digital Privacy: Password Manager

Digital Privacy: Password Manager was a console application that I created with Michael Merritt for the Quinnipiac Computing Club's Fall 2020 Hackathon. The theme of the hackathon was to create something that involved "digital privacy." We decided to look at the issue of account security, and we created a simple password manager that would be able to read and write to files to encrypt and decrypt passwords using 128-bit AES encryption. The entire program was written in Scala using a couple Java packages to handle the encryption process. We placed second overall, and copies of our presentation materials have been included in the repository. 

This was a great learning experience for me, as I was able to learn about how computers use encryption to protect sensitive data. I also learned about how to read and write to files with Scala. The concept of coming up with a project given a general theme was a new experience for me, and the time pressure helped to show me the value of making quick decisions and being able to change those decisions if an idea does not work out.

## Sitting Ducks

Sitting Ducks was a game that I developed with Michael Merritt for the [Quinnipiac Game Dev Club eJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/quinnipiac-game-dev-club-ejam-2020). We had a week to create a game from nothing that related to the theme of "moving forward." Using the Unity Engine, we developed a small puzzle game where the player needs to place tiles to guide a duck to a duckling and to a goal. I was in charge of writing the C# scripts that defined the player behavior and the various game elements. We placed fifth overall, but we came in first place for representation of the jam's theme. Our submission is available on [itch.io](https://meepix.itch.io/sitting-ducks) as a standalone Windows application. A playable build is available [online](./game).

This was a fun project to work on, and it showed me the value of tools like Git and GitHub, as we had a lot of trouble trying to share the code and builds of the game with one another. I was also able to learn a lot about working with C# and Unity, as I had minimal exposure to either when I started this project.
